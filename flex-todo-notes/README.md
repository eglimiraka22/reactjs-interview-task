## This is a Todo Simple Implementation App build for Flex Business Solutions 

`Relating to the task please add answers to the following questions`

### 1- How might you make this app more secure?

This is a simple Todo App but to make the app more secure there  we can consider implementing the following measures:

`1 - Secure Backend` \
`2 - Authentication and Authorization` \
`3 - Error Handling messages` \
`4 - Serve the app over HTTPS to encrypt communication between client and server ` \


### 2- How would you make this solution scale to millions of records?


`1 - Using the right database to handle the records` \
`2 - A backend Server to handle the requests done by the clients` \
`3 - Virtual Scrolling to handle larg amount of records` \
`4 - Optimized Queries or Fetching Functions to retrive only the necessary data` \

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
